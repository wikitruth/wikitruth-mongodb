The Yajurveda contains both prose and verse, providing instructions for priests to perform sacrificial rites, along with associated prayers and mantras.</li><li>Atharvaveda: The Atharvaveda is a collection of hymns, spells, and incantations that address various aspects of daily life, such as health, marriage, and protection from enemies.
