A system to end cyclic, unhealthy discussions, and debates on the internet that not only waste our time and add confusion but also damage&nbsp;our view of life and the world.</p><p>Arguments are the core of the Wikitruth Project. Every argument is a claim or assertion, and popular or controversial arguments are very crucial to our understanding of the world.</p><p>The aim of the project is to document all important claims about the world and attack them hard using reason and all the available supporting evidence. At the end, what we will get is a clear distinction of what true and what is not, what to believe and accept as true and what to reject or even take caution not to believe. We do not remove a content just because it is false, as much as we want to expose what is true, we want to have a strong emphasis to show what is false.</p><p><b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><b>Foreword</b></span></b></span></b></p><p>The system was designed based on the assumption that&nbsp;<strong>truth</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>morality</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>reason</strong>&nbsp;are of great fundamental importance to us as humans.
