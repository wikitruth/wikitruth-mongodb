Fake news is written and published with the intent to mislead in order to gain financially or politically, often with sensationalist, exaggerated, or patently false headlines that grab attention. Intentionally misleading and deceptive fake news is different from obvious satire or parody. Fake news often employs eye-catching headlines or entirely fabricated news stories to increase readership, online sharing and Internet click revenue. In the latter case, it is similar to sensational online \"clickbait\" headlines and relies on advertising revenue generated from this activity, regardless of the veracity of the published stories.</p><p>Easy access to online advertisement revenue, increased political polarization, and the popularity of social media, primarily the Facebook newsfeed, have all been implicated in the spread of fake news. Anonymously-hosted fake news websites lacking known publishers have also been credited, because they make it difficult to prosecute sources of fake news for libel. The relevance of fake news has increased in a post-truth political reality.</p><p>Seven types of fake news:</p><ol><li>satire or parody (\"no intention to cause harm but has potential to fool\")</li><li>false connection (\"when headlines, visuals of captions don't support the content\")</li><li>misleading content (\"misleading use of information to frame an issue or an individual\")</li><li>false content (\"when genuine content is shared with false contextual information\")</li><li>imposter content (\"when genuine sources are impersonated\" with false, made-up sources)</li><li>manipulated content (\"when genuine information or imagery is manipulated to deceive\", as with a\"doctored\" photo)</li><li>fabricated content (\"new content is 100% false, designed to deceive and do harm\")</li></ol>","contentPreview":"Fake news is a type of yellow journalism that consists of deliberate misinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media.
