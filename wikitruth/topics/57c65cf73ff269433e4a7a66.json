It is composed of two parts: the Mishnah and the Gemara. The Gemara is a series of rabbinic commentaries and discussions on the Mishnah, further exploring and analyzing its teachings. There are two versions of the Talmud: the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud, with the Babylonian Talmud being more widely studied and authoritative.</li><li>Midrash: The Midrash is a collection of Jewish interpretative literature that seeks to explain, elaborate, and clarify the meanings of biblical texts. It comprises both halakhic (legal) and aggadic (narrative) elements, incorporating stories, homilies, and parables to convey ethical teachings and insights into the biblical text. Midrashim (plural of Midrash) often provide additional context and background information to help readers understand the underlying messages and significance of biblical stories and commandments.</li></ol>","childrenCount":{"topics":{"total":0,"accepted":0,"pending":0,"rejected":0},"artifacts":{"total":0,"accepted":0,"pending":0,"rejected":0},"arguments":{"total":0,"accepted":0,"pending":0,"rejected":0},"questions":{"total":0,"accepted":0,"pending":0,"rejected":0},"issues":{"total":0,"accepted":0,"pending":0,"rejected":0,"acceptedCritical":0},"opinions":{"total":0,"accepted":0,"pending":0,"rejected":0}},"outline":[],"ethicalStatus":{"hasValue":false},"private":false,"screeningStatus":0,"tags":[],"ownerType":-1,"ownerId":null,"screening":{"status":1,"history":[]},"categoryId":"57a375e0e1538d1270f981ec","contentPreview":"The Tanach, Mishnah, Talmud, and Midrash are significant Jewish religious texts that have shaped Jewish thought, law, and tradition throughout history.\n\n 1.
